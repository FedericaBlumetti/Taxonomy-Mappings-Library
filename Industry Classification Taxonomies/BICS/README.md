## Summary Observations

- As a proprietary classification system, the full BICS hierarchy is unavailable for modelling.
- However, the EU Commission's Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance published partial mappings between BICS and the economic activities classified under the EU Taxonomy in March 2020, as part of its report on recommendations for technical screening criteria for these activities and their contribution to environmental objectives.
- These mappings have therefore been used to construct a partial taxonomy for the BICS system.

## Further Commentary

While most industry classification data is broad based and stops at a company’s description, Bloomberg classification data digs deeper to provide complete asset class coverage based on actual research, thereby delivering high-quality and consistent segmentation data across trading, risk management and operations. Bloomberg classification data can be accessed through both the Bloomberg Terminal® and via an enterprise data feed. 

The Bloomberg Industry Classification Systems (BICS) is a proprietary hierarchical classification system, which classifies firms’ general business activities. 

The diagram below shows the reconstruction of BICS hierarchical tree system with its 2294 hierarchical Sectors. The coloured lines show the classification level.
