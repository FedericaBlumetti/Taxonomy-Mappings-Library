## Summary Observations

- Most major industry classification systems use sources of revenue as their basis for classifying companies into specific sectors and industries. 
- In order to group like companies based on their sustainability-related risks and opportunities, a new industry classification was needed. The Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS) solves that problem. 
- The differences between SICS and traditional industry classification systems can be categorized in three types: (1) new thematic sectors; (2) new industries with unique sustainability profiles; and (3) industries classified in different sectors.

## Further Commentary

Unlike other industry classification systems—which use common financial and market characteristics— SICS uses sustainability profiles to group similar companies within industries and sectors. In SICS, a company’s sustainability risks and opportunities are more important for its classification than other traditional factors, such as economic cycles and revenue streams. A company’s SICS® classification is determined by overlaying its sustainability framework to other industry taxonomies.

Available for 77 industries, the Standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance issues most relevant to financial performance in each industry. A breakdown of the 77 industries across 11 sectors can be found [here](https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SICS-Industry-List.pdf).
