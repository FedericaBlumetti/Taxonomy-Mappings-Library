## Summary Observations
Refinitiv owns and runs the Refinitiv Business Classification, a system for categorising industries. By combining linked businesses and organisations that provide goods and services into comparable end markets, the market-oriented approach keeps track of an organisation's core business and reflects methods used around the globe.
The investing community uses TRBC for benchmarking, aggregation, and navigation. It offers a universal standard for accurately classifying peers, categorising research, gathering financial content, and distilling the deluge of Refinitiv news and data into perceptive trends. It provides a strong framework for benchmarking portfolios, collecting financial statistics, and attribution research.

## Further Commentary
TRBC consists of five levels of hierarchical structure, which are economic sector, business sector, industry group, industry and activity, from top to bottom. We use the 2012 schema which consists of 10 economic sectors, 28 business sectors, 54 industry groups, 136 industries and 837 activities:

TRBC is utilised to categorise businesses as a whole. When an organisation has several business sectors, the one with the biggest revenue contribution is chosen as the representative business. When appropriate, the assignment procedure, which is described below, also takes into account aspects like profitability, asset utilisation, and market perception. The lowest level, an Industry, is given to a company. The categorisation hierarchy serves as the foundation for the industry group, business sector, and economic sector assignments. There is only one primary TRBC Industry assigned to each business, and they are not permitted to have more than one primary assignment.
