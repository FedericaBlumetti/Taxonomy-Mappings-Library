## Summary Observations

- UK SIC 2007 is the current Standard Industrial Classification SIC used in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged.
- The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data, and its use promotes uniformity.
- In addition, it can be used for administrative purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.

## Further Commentary

UK SIC 2007 took effect from 1 January 2008 and is the outcome of a series of consultations carried out in conjunction with a major revision of the European Union’s industrial classification system, NACE (NACE Rev. 2).

The consultations involved many stakeholders:
- the national statistical institutes of all EU member states
- the European Commission
- In the UK, a range of government departments, the Bank of England, the devolved administrations, business and trade associations and other interested bodies
- European business and trade associations

The UK is required by European legislation to revise the SIC in parallel with NACE so that both systems remain identical down to and including the four digit class level. A further breakdown is provided for certain classes by the addition of a five digit subclass level. Both the UK SIC (2007) and NACE Rev. 2 are completely consistent with the fourth revision of the UN’s International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 4).
