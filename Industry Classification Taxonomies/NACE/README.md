## Summary Observations

NACE, derived from the French term "Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne" (EN: Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community), is the European standard classification of productive economic activities. It has been used to designate the various statistical classifications of economic activities developed since 1970 in the European Union. Use of NACE is mandatory within the European Statistical System.

NACE is one of many international, national and regional classification systems used currently. There is significant value in being able to compare industrial and economic statistics gathered through the various methodologies as assignment of certain Industry classifications is often mandatory in their respective jurisdictions.

## Further Commentary

**Relationship with other Multinational Classifications**

Several other existing international industry classification systems can be mapped to NACE, either based on being derived from the same initial framework or intuitively based on similarities across the activity types themselves. The below research summarises these relationships.

**1. ISIC - United Nations’ International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities.**

- NACE is derived from [ISIC](https://github.com/FD-SustainableFinance/RESEARCH-ISIC) but provides more granularity from a European Point of View. 
- ISIC and NACE have exactly the same items at the highest levels but NACE is more detailed at lower levels (The first level and the second level of ISIC Rev. 4 (sections and divisions)) are identical to sections and divisions of NACE Rev. 2).

**2. UKSIC - Standard Industrial Classification UK** 

- Derived directly from NACE and ISIC but a fifth digit has been added to some subclasses of the NACE four digit classes. Thus, the UKSIC is a hierarchical five digit system. Also classifies economic activities.
- Documentation can be viewed [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007).

**3. SIC - Standard Industrial Classification** 

- SIC: System was last revised in 1987 and was last used by the Census Bureau for the 1992 Economic Census, and has been replaced by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS - _See below_) since 1997. Some US Government Departments and Agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), still use SIC.

**4. NAICS - North American Industry Classification System**
- [NAICS](https://github.com/FD-SustainableFinance/RESEARCH-NAICS) was developed in the mid-1990s to provide common industry definitions for Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
- First two digits designate sectors that represent general categories of economic activities. Therefore statistical data collected according to NAICS can be aggregated into the two-digit divisions of ISIC Rev. 4/NACE Rev. 2, ensuring comparability of data.
- Outside of first two digits, structures of ISIC and NAICS are substantially different as NAICS conceptual framework is production-oriented and classifies units, not activities.

**The below example details the relationship between the above Industry Classifications, for the example case Extraction of Natural Crude Petroleum:**
