## Summary Observations
Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) is a comprehensive and transparent rules-based classification methodology based on research and market trends designed to support investment solutions. It was launched in 2005 and enhanced in 2019 with the integration of the Russell Global Sectors (RGS) classification scheme and additional structural enhancements.

ICB is widely adopted by global institutional clients and has many application use cases:
- Asset managers: Sector exposure analysis, strategy execution and attribution reporting.
- Data providers: A reference data map allowing systems to categorize, manage and follow companies by industry.
- Exchanges: Used by stock exchanges globally to categorize listed companies, including London Stock Exchange, Euronext, NASDAQ OMX, Johannesburg Stock Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange, Borsa Italiana, Athens Exchange, Cyprus Stock Exchange, and Boursa Kuwait.

## Further Commentary

ICB is supported by an independent external advisory committee that comprises top industry sector market practitioners. It leverages the [FTSE Russell Governance](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/FTSE_Russell_Governance_Framework.pdf) process, capturing collective perspectives and insights from industry experts around the world.

Its four-tier structure offers a robust system for comparing and analysing like-organizations:
- 11 Industries
- 20 Supersectors
- 45 Sectors
- 173 Subsectors

Companies are allocated to subsectors based on a transparent research process to determine the nature of their business, which includes assessment of revenue source data and other publicly available information. Users can:
- Understand exactly how and why companies are allocated in the [Ground Rules](https://www.ftse.com/products/downloads/ICB_Rules_new.pdf)
