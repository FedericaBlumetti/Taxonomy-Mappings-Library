## Summary Observations
- In 1999, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices developed the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), seeking to offer an efficient investment tool to capture the breadth, depth and evolution of industry sectors.
- GICS is a four-tiered, hierarchical industry classification system.
- Companies are classified quantitatively and qualitatively. Each company is assigned a single GICS classification at the Sub-Industry level according to its principal business activity. MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices use revenues as a key factor in determining a firmâ€™s principal business activity.
- Earnings and market perception, however, are also recognized as important and relevant information for classification purposes, and are taken into account during the annual review process.

## Further Commentary

**Relations with other Multinational Classifications**

**GICS vs ICB vs TRBC**

The GICS, ICB and TRBC classifications are very similar to each other. The terms sector and industry have different meanings for grouping with the GICS and ICB classifications. Also, the TRBC classification uses the term Industry group at a different sub-group level to GICS.

The sector and industry group terminology used by GICS tends to be the more common reference cited by the financial press and is the reference used throughout this website. Although there is some reference to the ICB classification system which is used by NYSE, it is more common for the financial press to cite the GICS terminology. This means that the broad grouping of the 10 main groups is more often referred to as sectors rather than industries.

Note that the ICB classification refers to sectors as Industries.
