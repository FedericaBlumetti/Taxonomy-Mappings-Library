## Summary Observations

- The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) is a United Nations industry classification system.
- ISIC classifies entities by activity. The most detailed categories are defined by combinations of activities described in statistical units, considering the relative importance of the activities included in these classes.
- ISIC and NACE have exactly the same items at the highest levels but NACE is more detailed at lower levels (the first and second levels of ISIC Rev. 4 (sections and divisions) are identical to sections and divisions of NACE Rev. 2).

## Further Commentary

The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) is the international reference classification of productive activities. Its main purpose is to provide a set of activity categories that can be utilized for the collection and reporting of statistics according to such activities.

Since the adoption of the original version of ISIC in 1948, the majority of countries around the world have used ISIC as their national activity classification or have developed national classifications derived from ISIC. ISIC has therefore provided guidance to countries in developing national activity classifications and has become an important tool for comparing statistical data on economic activities at the international level. Wide use has been made of ISIC, both nationally and internationally, in classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the fields of economic and social statistics, such as for statistics on national accounts, demography of enterprises, employment and others. In addition, ISIC is increasingly used for non-statistical purposes.

The structure of the fourth revision of ISIC was considered and approved by the UN Statistical Commission at its thirty-seventh session, in March 2006, as the internationally accepted standard. It replaced the third revision of the classification and its update, Revision 3.1, which had been in use since 1989 and 2002, respectively.
