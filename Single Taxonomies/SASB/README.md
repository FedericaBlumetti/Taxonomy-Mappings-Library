## Summary Observations

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a nonprofit organisation that works independently. Its goal is to create and promote sustainability accounting standards that assist public companies in providing investors with important, decision-useful information. A thorough procedure that involves evidence-based research and substantial, balanced stakeholder input is used to carry out that aim.
SASB develop sustainability accounting standards most relevant to the financial performance in 77 industries to help businesses provide investors and other capital market participants with decision-useful information about a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities by identifying the sustainability disclosure topics that are most pertinent to enterprise value for the typical company in an industry.

## Further Commentary
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is an ESG guidance framework that sets standards for the disclosure of financially material sustainability information by companies to their investors.

In total, SASB standards track ESG issues and performance across 77 industries as set out in the SASB Materiality Map.

SASB's Standards are used to publish ESG measures by firms in industries from asset management to manufacturing. The SASB Materiality Map is one resource offered to illustrate how investors from various asset classes apply the standards. With the help of these technologies, companies may report in a way that is relevant to their investors and allows for transparency and specificity. SASB requests that businesses emphasise certain disclosures and offer advice on the best ways to present such Environmental, Social, and Governance themes using standardised formats. The standards set out by SASB focus on the information that should be presented, whilst making suggestions only regarding where and how to report. The goal of this flexibility is to provide businesses the freedom to disclose these data points in a way that works best for their business, whether that be through annual reports, registration documents, or other financial reporting methods.

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) was established by the IFRS Foundation Trustees in response to a pressing need for corporations to provide honest financial sustainability disclosures. In order to provide a worldwide benchmark for sustainability disclosures to the financial markets, the ISSB is dedicated to expanding on the work of current investor-focused reporting initiatives, such as SASB Standards.

By reporting in line with the SASB Standards, organisations can provide industry-based sustainability disclosures about opportunities and risks that have an impact on enterprise value. The Value Reporting Foundation (VRF), a global nonprofit organisation that had previously looked after these Standards, merged with the IFRS Foundation in August 2022, with the latter taking over responsibility for the SASB Standards.

For 77 sectors, SASB Standards pinpoint the subset of environmental, social, and governance challenges that are most crucial to financial performance and organisational value. The Standards were created through an exacting and open standard-setting procedure, which includes:

* fact-based research; 
* wide-ranging and equitable engagement from businesses, investors, and subject-matter experts; 
* fact-based research; - wide-ranging and equitable engagement from businesses, investors, and subject-matter experts; 

Global investors acknowledge SASB Standards as necessary criteria for businesses wishing to provide sustainability information that is uniform and comparable.
