## Summary Observations
What is SBTi?
The SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi call to action is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. The Science Based Targets initiative was established in 2015 to help companies to set emission reduction targets in line with climate science and Paris Agreement goals

What do they do?
We must urgently increase ambition in the fight against climate change.

The latest climate science sends a clear warning that we must dramatically curb temperature rise to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change.

Science-based targets show companies and financial institutions how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi):
Defines and promotes best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science.
Provides technical assistance and expert resources to companies who set science-based targets in line with the latest climate science.
Brings together a team of experts to provide companies with independent assessment and validation of targets.
The SBTi is the lead partner of the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign - an urgent call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders, mobilizing companies to set net-zero science-based targets in line with a 1.5°C future.
The change has already begun and action is gaining pace. Nearly one thousand organizations worldwide are leading the transition to a net-zero economy by setting emissions reduction targets grounded in climate science through the SBTi.

## Further Commentary
SBTi recommendations are important for transparency and best practice, but are not required. These criteria apply only to companies that are not classified as financial institutions and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Financial institutions can set targets using the SBTi criteria and guidance for financial institutions. SMEs should use the streamlined process to set targets in line with climate science. While every effort is made to keep companies informed of the latest criteria and recommendations, the initiative reserves the right to make adjustments as needed to reflect the most recent emissions scenarios, partner organization policies, and greenhouse gas accounting practices.The initiative also reserves the right to withdraw the validation of an approved target if it becomes apparent that incorrect information was communicated during the target validation process that results in any of the criteria existing during the assessment not being met, or if requirements following the approval of the target are not respected (i.e. target progress reporting and recalculations). Unless otherwise noted (including specific sections), all criteria apply to scopes 1, 2, and 3.

The SBTi mobilizes the private sector to take the lead on urgent climate action.

Science-based targets show companies and financial institutions how much and how quickly businesses need to reduce their GHG emissions to prevent the worst impacts of climate change - leading them on a clear path towards decarbonization.

By guiding companies in science-based target setting, we enable them to tackle global warming while seizing the benefits and boosting their competitiveness in the transition to a net-zero economy.

Action is needed in key sectors, many of which require tailored approaches to setting targets. The SBTi provides clarity and guidance on these journeys, including for the forest, land and agriculture and finance sectors.

The SBTi is has also launched the world's first Corporate Net-Zero Standard, to ensure that companies’ net-zero targets translate into action that is consistent with achieving a net-zero world by no later than 2050.
n 2021, the SBTi entered a period of exponential growth and increasing corporate ambition - doubling the number of new companies setting and committing to set targets, and tripling the rate at which new targets were validated. At the end of 2021, more than 2,200 companies covering over a third of the global economy’s market capitalization, were working with the SBTi - a rate of more than 110 new companies per month.

These companies are leading the way. However, we need every company, in every sector, to join them. The future of our planet depends on this.

The launch of the SBTi Net-Zero Standard ahead of COP26 was a milestone, providing the world’s first framework for corporate net-zero target setting. Anchored in climate science and 1.5°C pathways, the Standard requires companies to make rapid and deep emission cuts, through both near- and long-term science-based targets.

Science-based target setting is already becoming part of the yearly reporting practice of companies and the data infrastructure for institutional investors through incorporation in the CDP questionnaire and scoring.
