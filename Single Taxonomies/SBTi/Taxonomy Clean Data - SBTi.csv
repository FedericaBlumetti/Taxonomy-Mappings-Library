Layer,Object,Attribute,Criteria
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,R13 - Validity of target projections,"The SBTi recommends that companies check the validity of target-related projections on an annual basis. The company should notify the SBTi of any significant changes and report these major changes publicly, as relevant."
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,R12 - Triggered target recalculation,"Targets should be recalculated, as needed, to reflect significant changes that could compromise relevance and consistency of the existing target. The following changes should trigger a target recalculation: ● Scope 3 emissions become 40% or more of aggregated scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions;Emissions of exclusions in the inventory or target boundary change significantly;
● Significant changes in company structure and activities (e.g. acquisitions, divestitures,
mergers, insourcing or outsourcing, shifts in goods or service offerings);
● Significant adjustments to the base year inventory or changes in data to set targets such
as growth projections (e.g. discovery of significant errors or a number of cumulative
errors that are collectively significant);
● Other significant changes to projections/assumptions used in setting the science-based
targets."
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,R11 - Where to disclose,"There are no specific requirements regarding where the inventory and progress against published targets should be disclosed, as long as it is publicly available. The SBTi recommends disclosure through standardized, comparable data platforms such as CDP’s climate change annual questionnaire, though annual reports, sustainability reports and the company’s website are acceptable."
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,C27 - Target validity,"Companies with approved targets must announce their target publicly on the SBTi website within 6 months of the approval date. Targets unannounced after 6 months must go through the approval process again, unless a different publication time frame has been agreed in writing with the SBTi."
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,C26 - Mandatory target recalculation,"To ensure consistency with the most recent climate science and best practices, targets must be reviewed, and if necessary, recalculated and revalidated, at a minimum every 5 years. For companies with targets approved in 2020 or earlier, the latest year targets must be revalidated is 2025. Companies with an approved target that requires recalculation must follow the most recent applicable criteria at the time of resubmission."
SBTi,Reporting and Recalculation,C25 - Frequency,The company shall publicly report its company-wide GHG emissions inventory and progress against published targets on an annual basis.
SBTi,"Sector Specific Guidance ",C24 - Requirements from sector-specific guidance,"Companies must follow requirements for target setting and minimum ambition levels as indicated in relevant sector-specific methods and guidance at the latest, 6 months after the sector guidance publication"
SBTi,Ambition,C23 - Companies in the fossil fuel production business or with significant revenue from fossil fuel business lines,"Companies involved in exploration, extraction, mining and/or production of oil, natural gas, coal as well as other fossil fuels cannot get their targets validated at this stage, irrespective of percentage revenue generated by these activities. Companies that derive 50% or more of their revenue from fossil fuels cannot have their targets validated at this time, and must follow the respective sector methodology once published."
SBTi,Ambition,C22 - Fossil fuel sales or distribution,"All companies involved in the sale or distribution of natural gas and/or other fossil fuels products shall set near-term and long-term scope 3 targets that are at a minimum consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C, irrespective of the share of these emissions compared to the total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions of the company. Customer engagement targets as described in C19 are not eligible for this criterion. More guidance is detailed in C23 on the 50% revenue threshold for companies with fossil fuel activities."
SBTi,Ambition,R10 - Efficiency considerations for target modelling,"If companies are using a method that does not already embed efficiency gains for the specific sector, market, and the decarbonization projected for the power sector based on 1.5°C scenario, it is recommended that these factors be taken into account when modelling electricity-related scope 2 targets."
SBTi,Ambition,R9 - Purchased heat and steam:,"For science-based target modelling purposes using the SDA, it is recommended that companies model purchased heat and steam related emissions as if they were part of their direct (i.e. scope 1) emissions"
SBTi,Ambition,C21 - Renewable electricity,"Targets to actively source renewable electricity at a rate that is
consistent with 1.5°C scenarios are an acceptable alternative to scope 2 emission reduction
targets. The SBTi has identified 80% renewable electricity procurement by 2025 and 100% by
2030 as thresholds (portion of renewable electricity over total electricity use) for this approach
in line with the recommendations of RE100. Companies that already source electricity at or
above these thresholds shall maintain or increase their use of renewable electricity to qualify."
SBTi,Ambition,C20 - Combined scope targets,"Targets that combine scopes (e.g. 1+2 or 1+2+3) are permitted. When submitting combined targets, the scope 1+2 portion must be in line with at least a 1.5°C scenario and the scope 3 portion of the target must be in line with at least a wellbelow 2°C scenario. For sectors where minimum target ambition is further specified for companies’ scope 3 activities, C24 supersedes C20."
SBTi,Ambition,R8 - Supplier engagement,"Companies should recommend that their suppliers use the SBTi guidance and tools available to set science-based targets. SBTi validation of supplier sciencebased targets is recommended but not required. It is recommended that suppliers classified as small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), submit targets through the SME streamlined route."
SBTi,Ambition,C19 - Supplier or customer engagement targets,"Near-term targets to drive the adoption of science-based emission reduction targets by their suppliers and/or customers are in conformance with SBTi criteria when the following conditions are met: ● Boundary: Companies may set engagement targets around relevant and credible upstream or downstream categories. ● Formulation: Companies shall provide information in the target language on what percentage of emissions from relevant upstream and/or downstream categories is covered by the engagement target or, if that information is not available, what percentage of annual procurement spend is covered by the target. 9 ● Timeframe: Companies’ engagement targets must be fulfilled within a maximum of 5 years from the date the company’s target is submitted to the SBTi for an official validation.10 ● Level of ambition: The company’s suppliers/customers shall have science-based emission reduction targets in line with SBTi resources"
SBTi,Ambition,C18 - Level of ambition for scope 3 emissions reductions targets,"At a minimum, near-term scope 3 targets (covering the entire value chain or individual scope 3 categories) must be aligned with methods consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global
temperature increase well-below 2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures."
SBTi,Ambition,R7 - Choosing an approach,The SBTi recommends using the most ambitious decarbonization scenarios that lead to the earliest reductions and the least cumulative emissions.
SBTi,Ambition,C17 - Intensity targets,Intensity targets for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are only eligible when they are modelled using an approved 1.5°C sector pathway applicable to companies’ business activities.
SBTi,Ambition,C16 - Absolute targets,Absolute reductions must be at least as ambitious as the minimum of the approved range of emissions scenarios consistent with the 1.5°C goal.
SBTi,Ambition,C15 - Level of ambition for scope 1 and 2 targets,"At a minimum, scope 1 and scope 2 targets must be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures."
SBTi,Target Formulation,R6 - Consistency,It is recommended that companies use the same base years for all nearterm targets
SBTi,Target Formulation,R5 - Long-term target year,"Targets that cover more than 10 years from the date of submission are considered long-term targets. Companies are encouraged to develop such long-term targets up to 2050 in addition to near-term targets required by C13 (see Net-Zero C17). At a minimum, long-term targets must be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures to be validated and recognized by the SBTi."
SBTi,Target Formulation,C14 - Progress to date,"The minimum forward-looking ambition of targets is consistent with reaching net-zero by 2050, assuming a linear absolute reduction, linear intensity reduction, or intensity convergence between the most recent year and 2050 (not increasing absolute emissions or intensity)"
SBTi,Target Formulation,C13 - Base and target years,Targets must cover a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 10 years from the date the target is submitted to the SBTi for validation7 . The choice of base year must be no earlier than 2015.
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,R4 - Bioenergy data reporting,"The SBTi recommends that companies report direct biogenic CO2 emissions and removals from bioenergy separately. Emissions and removals of CO2 associated with bioenergy shall be reported as net emissions according to C10, at a minimum, but companies are encouraged to also report gross emissions and gross removals from bioenergy feedstocks."
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,R3 - Biofuel certification,The SBTi recommends that companies using or producing biofuel(s) for transport should support their bioenergy GHG accounting with recognized biofuel certification(s) to disclose that the data on land-related emissions and removals represents the relevant biofuel feedstock production
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,C12 - Avoided emissions,Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets.
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,C11 - Carbon credits,"The use of carbon credits must not be counted as emission reductions toward the progress of companies’ near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered to be an option for neutralizing residual emissions (see Net-Zero C30) or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond their science-based emission reduction targets
(see Net-Zero R3)."
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,C10 - Bioenergy accounting,"CO2 emissions from the combustion, processing and distribution phase of bioenergy and the land use emissions and removals6 associated with bioenergy feedstocks, shall be reported alongside a company’s GHG inventory. Furthermore, CO2 emissions from the combustion, processing and distribution phase of bioenergy and the land use emissions and removals associated with bioenergy feedstocks shall be included in the target boundary when setting a science-based target (in scopes 1, 2, and/or 3, as relevant) and when reporting progress against that target. Land-related emissions accounting shall include CO2 emissions from direct land use change
(LUC) and non-LUC emissions, inclusive of N2O and CH4 emissions from land use
management. Including emissions associated with indirect LUC is optional.

Companies are expected to adhere to any additional GHG Protocol Guidance on bioenergy
accounting when released in order to maintain compliance with criterion 10"
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,C9 - Scope 3 screening,Companies must complete a scope 3 inventory covering gross scope 3 emissions for all its emissions sources as set out as the minimum boundary5 of each scope 3 category per the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
SBTi,Emissions accounting requirements,C8  - Scope 2 accounting approach,"Companies shall disclose whether they are using a location- or market-based accounting approach as per the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance to calculate base year emissions and to track performance against a science-based target. GHG Protocol requires measuring and reporting scope 2 emissions using both approaches. However, a single and consistent approach shall be used for setting and tracking progress toward a SBT (e.g., using location-based approach for both target setting and progress tracking)."
SBTi,Method Validity,C7 - Method validity,Targets must be modelled using the latest version of methods and tools approved by the initiative. Targets modelled using previous versions of the tools or methods can only be submitted to the SBTi for validation within 6 months of the publication of the revised method or the publication of relevant sector-specific tools
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,R2 - Targets covering optional scope 3 emissions,"Targets to reduce scope 3 emissions that fall outside the minimum boundary4 of scope 3 categories are not required, but are encouraged when these emissions are significant. This can include targets to influence the behavior of endusers (e.g. education campaigns) or to drive the adoption of science-based targets on customers (e.g. customer engagement targets). Companies may cover these emissions with a scope 3 target, but such targets cannot count towards the two-thirds threshold defined in C6 for scope 3 emissions (i.e., these targets are above and beyond the company’s scope 3 targets). For reference, consult page 48 in the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard and the Target Validation Protocol for a list of products that generate direct and indirect use-phase emissions."
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C6 - Scope 3 emissions coverage for near-term targets,Companies must set one or more emission reduction targets and/or supplier or customer engagement targets that collectively cover(s) at least two-thirds (67%) of total scope 3 emissions considering the minimum boundary of each scope 3 category in conformance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C5 - Scope 1 and 2 significance thresholds,Companies may exclude up to 5% of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions combined in the boundary of the inventory and target
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C4 - Requirement to have a scope 3 target,"If a company’s relevant scope 3 emissions are 40% or more of total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, a scope 3 target is required. All companies involved in the sale or distribution of natural gas and/or other fossil fuels shall set scope 3 targets for the use of sold products, irrespective of the share of these emissions compared to the total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions of the company."
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C3 - Scope 1 and Scope 2,"The targets must cover company-wide scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard."
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C2 - Greenhouse Gases,The targets must cover all relevant GHGs as required per the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard.
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,R1 - Setting organizational boundaries,"The SBTi recommends that a company's organizational boundary, as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, is consistent with the organizational boundary used in the company’s financial accounting and reporting procedures."
SBTi,GHG Emissions Inventory and Target Boundary,C1 - Organizational Boundary,"It is recommended that companies submit targets only at the parent- or group-level, not at the subsidiary level. Parent companies must include the emissions of all subsidiaries in their target submission, in accordance with boundary criteria above. In cases where both parent companies and subsidiaries submit targets2 , the parent company’s target must also include the emissions of the subsidiary if it falls within the parent company’s emissions boundary given the chosen inventory consolidation approach"
