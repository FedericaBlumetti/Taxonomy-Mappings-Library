## Summary Observations
NGOs from the corporate and environmental sectors form the global alliance known as Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB). CDSB are devoted to improving and harmonising the worldwide mainstream corporate reporting model to compare natural and financial capital on an equal footing.
They achieve this by providing businesses with a framework for reporting environmental data with the same care as financial data. As a result, they are better able to allocate capital efficiently by providing investors with environmental information that can be used to make decisions through the mainstream corporate report. Materials that are compliant are advantageous to regulators as well.

CDSB's work creates the trust and openness required to support robust capital markets, recognising that knowledge about natural capital and financial capital is equally important for understanding company performance. CDSB's goal is to help create economic, social, and environmental systems that are more sustainable.

## Further Commentary
The CDSB seeks to promote investor analysis and decision-making that recognises the reliance and effects of economic and financial stability on natural, human, and social capital through the dissemination of reliable environmental and social information. The Framework is a standards-ready instrument that businesses may use to disclose information on climate change in regular financial reports. The Framework for Reporting Environmental Information, Natural Capital, and Associated Business Impacts, which was revised in April 2018, relies on and adopts pertinent provisions of current standards and practises, including the TCFD recommendations and International Financial Reporting Standards, and it also takes into account mandatory and voluntary reporting requirements and carbon trading regulations. The Framework stands out because it uses existing standards rather than developing new ones.

In order to complement popular forms of financial reporting, the Framework also includes pertinent concepts and goals.
The goals of the framework include:
* Assist businesses in converting their sustainability data into long-term value;
* Investors should receive information that is consistent, simple, and explains how the organization's sustainability performance relates to its entire strategy, performance, and prospects;
* Enable and promote the deployment of financial resources by knowledgeable investors;
* Increase the usefulness of an organisation's current mainstream report while reducing reporting requirements and streamlining the reporting process;
* Support the proper rigour for information presented to investors; 
* Encourage standardisation of environmental and social information reporting; 
* Aid in the creation of assurable reports.
