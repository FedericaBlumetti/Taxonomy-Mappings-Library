## Summary Observations

- The proposed rule would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks and certain climate-related financial statement metrics. 
- This would include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions, which have become a commonly used metric to assess a registrant’s exposure to climate risks.
- The proposed disclosure requirements are industry agnostic at present, with no industry-specific reporting or metrics required.

# Further Commentary

A domestic or international registrant would have to provide certain climate-related information in its registration statements and periodic reports under rule modifications the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf) proposed. The proposed disclosures are comparable to those that many businesses now provide based on widely used disclosure frameworks, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and would include:
* How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the registrant's strategy, business model, and outlook
* How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the registrant's processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks 
* How any identified climate-related risks have manifested over the short-, medium-, or long-term.
* Indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in a registrant’s value chain (Scope 3), if material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions target or goal that includes Scope 3 emissions, in absolute terms, not including offsets, and in terms of intensity
* A registrant may also provide information about any identified climate-related opportunities in response to any of the governance, strategy, and risk management elements of the proposed rules.
