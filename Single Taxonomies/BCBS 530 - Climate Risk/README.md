## Summary Observations

- Following initial release for public consultation in November 2021, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued updated principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks in June 2022.
- Of 18 principles in total, 12 relate to the management of climate-related financial risks by banks, with the remaining 6 addressing supervisory requirements. 
- The principles are based on existing reference principles, which are noted in the documentation published by the BCBS.

# Further Commentary

To address climate-related financial risks within the banking sector, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) established a high-level Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks in 2020 to contribute to the Committee’s mandate to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. Previous analytical work conducted by the BCBS has led to the publication of reports on [Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels](http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf), and [Climate-related financial risks – measurement methodologies](http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf).

Through the June 2022 publication of Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks, the BCBS aims to improve both banks' risk management and supervisors' practices related to climate-related financial risks. Principles address the following overarching themes in relation to management of climate-related financial risks by banks:
- Corporate governance
- Internal control framework
- Capital and liquidity adequacy
- Risk management process
- Management monitoring and reporting
- Comprehensive management of credit risk
- Comprehensive management of market, liquidity, operational and other risks
- Scenario analysis

Themes for supervisors are as follows:
- Prudential regulatory and supervisory requirements for banks
- Responsibilities, powers and functions of supervisors

The principles seek to achieve a balance in improving practices related to the management of climate-related financial risks and providing a common baseline for internationally active banks and supervisors, while maintaining sufficient flexibility given the degree of heterogeneity and evolving practices in this area.

The BCBS, in designing the principles for management and supervision of climate-related financial risks, has referenced existing principles under the Basel framework, and these are called out within the documentation to allow for cross-referencing. These reference principles are also included in the taxonomy model provided above. Similarities were also noted between the BCBS Climate Risk principles and those published under existing guidelines, including BCBS 239 - Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting. This will be the subject of further research by the OS-SFT Contributing Partners.
