## Summary Observations
-	The Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) (Directive 2014/95/EU) outlines the rules on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by large public-interest companies (rules on this are outlined below). This directive amends the Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU. 
-	These rules apply to large public-interest companies with more than 500 employees. These include: listed companies, banks, insurance companies and other companies designated by national authorities as public-interest entities. 
-	The Directive 2014/95/EU, provides guidance to companies on publishing large companies have to publish information related to environmental matters, social matters and treatment of employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery and diversity on company boards (in terms of age, gender, educational and professional background).
-	NOTE: The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) willl replace and expand the NFRD.

## Further Commentary
- The objective of the NFRD is to raise the transparency of the social and environmental information provided by undertakings in all sectors to a similarly high level across all Member States. Thus to improve the disclosure of non-financial information by certain large undertakings.
- On 21 April 2021, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which would amend the existing reporting requirements of the NFRD.
