## Summary Observations

- Following initial release for public consultation in June 2012, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued updated principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting in January 2013.
- Of 14 principles in total, 11 relate to the risk data aggregation and reporting practices within banks, with the remaining 3 addressing supervisory requirements. 
- Principles aim to strengthen banksâ€™ risk data aggregation capabilities and internal risk reporting practices, which in turn is expected to enhance risk management and decision-making processes.

# Further Commentary

The global financial crisis of 2008 revealed weaknesses in the risk aggregation and reporting capabilities of many financial institutions, with banks unable to identify risk exposue concentrations quickly or accurately and therefore unable to make sound risk decisions. Through the January 2013 publication of Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks, the BCBS aimed to strengthen risk management at banks and enhance their ability to cope with stress and crisis situations. Implementation by the largest globally importany banks was required by the early 2016. Principles address the following overarching themes in relation to the aggregation and reporting capabilities of banks:
- Overarching governance and infrastructure
- Risk data aggregation capabilities
- Risk reporting practices

Themes for supervisors are as follows:
- Supervisory review, tools and cooperation
