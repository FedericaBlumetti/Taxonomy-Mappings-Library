## Summary Observations

The CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) is an international non-profit organisation based in the UK, Japan, India, China, Germany and the US that helps companies and cities disclose their environmental impact. It aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm, driving disclosure, insight, and action towards a sustainable economy. In 2021, over 14,000 organisations disclosed their environmental information through CDP. 

Capital markets and buying groups use CDP, which contains the broadest, most complete collection of environmental data available, to make knowledgeable decisions, recognise high-performing businesses, and inspire action.

## Detailed Research

A healthy economy that benefits both people and the earth over the long run is part of CDP's vision and goal. By assessing and taking action on their environmental effect, they bring investors, businesses, cities, and governments together to create a sustainable economy.

CDP's areas of work include: 
* Climate: Effective management of carbon and climate change risk requires increasing business understanding through measurement and transparency.
* Water: Utilising the influence of investors and consumers, work on water security encourages businesses to disclose and lessen their environmental consequences. Influential decision-makers may decrease risk, seize opportunities, and promote action toward a more sustainable future by using the data that CDP gathers.
* Forests: Outlines a framework for firms to use in managing forest-related risks and opportunities, reporting progress in a transparent manner, and pledging to take proactive measures to restore forests and ecosystems.

The largest and most complete dataset on environmental activity in the world is held by CDP, which has approximately 9,600 corporations as members. For motivating and monitoring global progress toward a carbon-free, water-secure, and deforestation-free society, CDP's insights are essential.

Through CDP's three corporate questionnaires on climate change, water security, and forests, businesses may provide information. This makes it easier for businesses to communicate with their customers, investors, and other stakeholders about their environmental objectives and strategies, governance, and risk and opportunity management. Through CDP, both investors and customers may ask businesses for environmental data, and these stakeholders can use the information to guide their decisions and take appropriate action.

Benefits of the CDP include: 
* Being open and honest about how a company's operations affect the environment establishes credibility and shows concern in relation to sustainability.
* Reporting assists in identifying cost-saving options and initiatives for both companies and customers.
* Credible reporting and results increase stakeholder confidence and make businesses more appealing to investors.
* Reporting on sustainability enables businesses to stay current with legal and non-financial reporting requirements.

By completely adhering to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), CDP reporting will also help organisations prepare for a time of tighter restrictions and assist them in staying one step ahead of this trend.
