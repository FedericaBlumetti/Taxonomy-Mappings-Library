Together, this coalition shared the view that communication about value creation, preservation or erosion is the next step in the evolution of corporate reporting. The IIRC developed the International Framework to meet this need and provide a foundation for the future."

• The financial reporting entity (i.e. the boundary used for financial reporting purposes)
• Risks, opportunities and outcomes attributable to or associated with other entities/stakeholders beyond the financial reporting entity that have a significant effect on the ability of the financial reporting entity to create value.
The financial reporting entity is central to the reporting boundary because: 
• It is the financial reporting entity in which providers of financial capital invest and therefore need information about
• Using the financial reporting entity enables the information in the financial statements to serve as an anchor or point of reference to which the other information in an integrated report can be related."

Information in the report is not slanted, weighted, emphasized, de-emphasized, combined, offset or otherwise manipulated to change the probability that it will be received either favourably or unfavourably. Important methods to ensure balance include: 
• Selection of presentation formats that are not likely to unduly or inappropriately influence assessments made on the basis of the integrated report
• Giving equal consideration to both increases and decreases in the capitals, both strengths and weaknesses of the organisation, both positive and negative performance, etc.
• Reporting against previously reported targets, forecasts, projections and expectations."

Accordingly, if a matter is important to managing the business, cost should not be a factor in failing to obtain critical information to appropriately assess and manage the matter. An organisation may evaluate cost and benefits when determining the extent, level of specificity, and preciseness of information necessary for an integrated report to meet its primary purpose, but may not refrain entirely from making any disclosure about a material matter on the basis of cost."

Accordingly, the organisation considers what advantage a competitor could actually gain from information in an integrated report, and balances this against the need for the integrated report to achieve its primary purpose."

Other powerful tools for enhancing comparability (in both an integrated report itself and any detailed information that it links to) can include: • Using benchmark data, such as industry or regional benchmarks • Presenting information in the form of ratios (e.g. research expenditure as a percentage of sales, or carbon intensity measures such as emissions per unit of output) • Reporting quantitative indicators commonly used by other organisations with similar activities, particularly when standardized definitions are stipulated by an independent organisation (e.g. an industry body).

Risks, opportunities and outcomes attributable to or associated with other entities/stakeholders are reported on in an integrated report to the extent they materially affect the ability of the financial reporting entity to create value. Practical issues might limit the nature and extent of information that can be presented in an integrated report. For example: • The availability of reliable data with respect to entities the financial reporting entity does not control • The inherent inability to identify all risks, opportunities and outcomes that will materially affect the ability of the financial reporting entity to create value, particularly in the long term. It may be appropriate to disclose such limitations, and actions being taken to overcome them, in an integrated report."

More detailed explanations might be provided in other communications. When information in an integrated report is similar to or based on other information published by the organization, it is prepared on the same basis as, or is easily reconcilable with, that other information. For example, when a key performance indicator covers a similar topic to, or is based on information published in the organization’s financial statements or sustainability report, it is prepared on the same basis, and for the same period, as that other information."
