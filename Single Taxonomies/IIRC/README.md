## Summary Observations

The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) was a global task force of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the accounting profession, academia and NGOs. Together, this coalition shared the view that communication about value creation, preservation or erosion is the next step in the evolution of corporate reporting.

The IIRC developed the International Integrated Reporting "IR" Framework to meet this need and provide a foundation for the future through:
  - A meaningful assessment of the long-term viability of the organisation’s business model and strategy;
  - Meeting the information needs of investors and other stakeholders; and
  - Ultimately, the effective allocation of scarce resources.

## Further Commentary

**Integrated Reporting - IR**
- Concise communication about how an organisation's strategy, governance, performance and prospects lead to the creation of value over the short, medium and long term.
- Results in a broader explanation of performance than traditional reporting. 
- Makes visible an organisation’s use of and dependence on different resources and relationships, or ‘Capitals’, and the organisation’s access to and impact on them.
  - The term 'Capitals' is used broadly to refer to any store of value that an organisation can use in the production of goods or services.

- Financial 
- Manufactured
- Human
- Intellectual
- Natural
