## Summary Observations
Climate change and the global response to the threats it poses have the potential to significantly impact the safety and soundness of federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs), and the financial system more broadly. These risks, also known as “climate-related risks”, are broadly categorized as physical and transition risks.

Physical and transition risks can also lead to liability risks, such as the risk of climate-related claims under liability policies, as well as direct actions against financial institutions for failing to manage their climate-related risks.

Climate-related risks may manifest over varying time horizons, and are likely to intensify over time, especially if the global economy undergoes a disorderly transition. They can drive financial risks, such as credit, market, insurance, and liquidity risks. They can also lead to strategic, operational, and reputational risks. In severe instances, climate-related risks can threaten the long-term viability of a FRFI’s business model.

Building resilience against climate-related risks requires FRFIs to address vulnerabilities in their business model, their overall operations, and ultimately on their balance sheet. This entails forward-looking approaches that are holistic, integrated, and built on reliable empirical data and sound analyses.
The Guideline establishes OSFI’s expectations related to the FRFI’s management of climate-related risks. It aims to support FRFIs in developing greater resilience to, and management of, these risks. The Guideline applies to all federally regulated financial institutions.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach for managing climate-related risks given the unique risks and vulnerabilities that will vary with a FRFI’s size, nature, scope, and complexity of its operations, and risk profile. The Guideline should be read, and implemented, from a risk-based perspective that allows the FRFI to compete effectively while managing its climate-related risks prudently.
