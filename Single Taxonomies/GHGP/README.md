## Summary Observations

- Greenhouse Gas Protocol provides the world's most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards for companies, as well as standards and tools that help countries and cities track progress toward climate goals.
- The GHG Protocol is primarily a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions inventories, rather than providing a reporting framework. However, it does offer an Emissions Inventory Reporting template to facilitate company reporting. 
- GHGP is closely linked to other initiatives through:
  - providing the primary emissions methodology for companies reporting to the CDP.
  - collaboration with PCAF to provide solutions to the financial industry for calculation of financed emissions.

## Further Commentary

The GHG Protocol establishes comprehensive global standardised frameworks for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. In partnership between World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the GHG Protocol supplies the world's most widely used GHG accounting standards with the flagship Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard providing the accounting platform for virtually every corporate GHG reporting program in the world.

The GHG Protocol is not focused on reporting of GHG emissions, although given its wide adoption a vast amount of information reported under other sustainability reporting initiative will be derived from GHG Protocol methodologies. In addition, a sample Emissions Inventory Reporting template is available to help outline the reporting recommendations of the GHG Protocol's Corporate Standard. To complement these standards and guidance, a number of cross-sector and sector-specific calculation tools are also provided, containing step-by-step guidance and electronic worksheets to help users calculate GHG emissions from specific sources or industries.
