## Summary Observations

- The world's largest corporate sustainability initiative, the UN Global Compact supports companies in doing business responsibly and taking strategic actions to advance broader societal goals.
- Participating companies align their strategies and operations with the Ten Principles relating to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.
- Participants are required to disclose annually via the Communication On Progress Questionnaire how they are upholding and implementing the Ten Principles.
- Opportunities were identified for mapping the disclosures required within the COP Questionnaire with the UN SDGs and the GRI.

## Further Commentary

The UN Global Compact is a sustainability initiative which aims to support the engagement of companies and stakeholders in responsible business practices and the collaboration and innovation required to advance broader societal objectives, such as those of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Participating companies are encouraged to align with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, and to undertake strategic activities to develop solutions for a more sustainable world.

The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact cover the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and are derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organizationâ€™s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Alignment with the Ten Principles is reportable via the Communication On Progess (COP) Questionnaire which must be completed annually by participating companies. Information reported in the COP Questionnaire is closely linked to other sustainability initiatives such as the UN SDGs, as well as disclosures under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The OS-SFT Contributing Partners intend to undertake further research in order to map requirements between these initiatives, for which taxonomies have already been produced.
