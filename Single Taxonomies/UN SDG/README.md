## Summary Observations

- The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, comprise a plan agreed to by all world leaders to build a greener, fairer, better world by 2030.
- The SDGs touch on all areas of sustainability, from climate and biodiversity to poverty and inequality.
- Multiple sustainability initiatives reference the UN SDGs and encourage participants to embed these goals within their strategies.
- An extensive target and indicator framework provides measurability to the goals and allows for the assessment of progress towards sustainable outcomes.

## Further Commentary

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the UN in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated, recognising that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.

In addition to the SDGs themselves, the UN has also designed a global indicator framework of targets and indicators for measuring progress towards each goal. These tend to be measured at country level, however there may also be opportunities to identify contributions at a company level, particularly given that other intitiatives such as the UN Global Compact are linked directly to the SDGs. This is an area of research the OS-SFT Contributing Partners intend to pursue further, for example by mapping between the SDG targets and indicators and the requirements of other sustainability initiatives.
