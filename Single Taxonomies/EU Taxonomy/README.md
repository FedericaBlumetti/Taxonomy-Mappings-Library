# Summary Observations
The EU taxonomy is a categorization scheme that creates a list of economically viable ecologically friendly activities. It will have a significant impact on how the EU scales up sustainable investment and puts the European Green Deal into practice. Companies, investors, and regulators would have access to proper definitions of whether economic activities qualify as ecologically sustainable thanks to the EU taxonomy. This should provide security for investors, safeguard private investors from greenwashing, assist businesses in becoming more environmentally friendly, lessen market fragmentation, and assist in directing investments to areas where they are most needed.

# Further Commentary
In order to combat greenwashing, the Taxonomy was developed to make it easier for market players to recognise and invest in sustainable assets. The Regulation, however, also imposes additional Taxonomy-linked disclosure requirements on businesses and financial market players.
The EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes six environmental objectives:
- Climate change mitigation
- Climate change adaptation
- The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
- The transition to a circular economy
- Pollution prevention and control
- The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems

Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) define the specific requirements and thresholds for an activity to be considered as significantly contributing to a sustainability objective. These TSCs are being elaborated in secondary legislation called Delegated Acts (DAs).

The environmental facets of ESG are significantly highlighted in the Taxonomy Regulation. If an investment satisfies one of the six environmental objectives above and does not materially impair any of the others, it may be marketed as sustainable. It appears that there is a move to examine whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be expanded to cover social issues in addition to a wider range of environmental factors, in advance of the publication of a new sustainable finance action plan next year, in light of recent comments made by the head of the sustainable finance and financial technology unit at the European Commission. There are no other information as of now.

See below for a summary of the progress of the EU Taxonomy and the forward-looking timetable:

* 22 June 2020: Taxonomy Regulation originally published, entering into force on 12 July 2020.
* 21 April 2021: TSC for substantial contribution/DNSH to climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives adopted.
* 9 December 2021: First delegated act published on sustainable activities for climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives (the 'Climate Delegated Act'), entering into force from January 2022. A second delegated act for the remaining objectives will be published later in 2022.
* 10 December 2021: Delegated Act supplementing Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published (the 'Disclosures Delegated Act'), entering into force from January 2022. This delegated act specifies the content, methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by financial and non-financial undertakings concerning the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities in their business, investments or lending activities.
* 9 March 2022: Complementary Climate Delegated Act adopted, including specific nuclear and gas energy activities in the list of economic activities covered by the EU taxonomy. Enters into force from January 2023.
* 13 July 2022: Deadline for first review of the Taxonomy (required every three years).
* Late 2022: It is intended that a second delegated act will be published on sustainable activities for the remaining objectives: water & marine resources use and protection; circular economy transition; pollution prevention & control; and biodiversity & ecosystems protection & restoration.

Reporting requirements set forth by the Disclosures Delegated Act mentioned above come into force progressively, based on the below timetable. The requirements are elaborated in the Annexes of the delegated act, and have been identified as an area of potential further research by the OS-SFT Contributing Partners.
