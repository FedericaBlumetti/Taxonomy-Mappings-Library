## Summary Observations
The GRI Standards assist organisations in comprehending their external effects, including those on human rights, on the economy, environment, and society. As a result, they are held more accountable and their contribution to sustainable development is more transparent. ​​

The GRI Standards are a modular system made up of a series of Universal Standards, Sector Standards, and Topic Standards.

The GRI Standards can be used by organisations to create sustainability reports that are compliant with the Standards, or they can use specific Standards, or portions of them, to report information for particular users or purposes, such as informing investors and consumers about their climate change impacts.

## Further Commentary
By giving them a universal common language to describe such impacts, the independent, multinational GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) organisation assists corporations and other organisations in accepting responsibility for their external effects.

GRI reporting makes businesses more accountable and transparent regarding their sustainability objectives, strategies, and results. Organisations can compile and present evidence that demonstrates substantial sustainability impacts using the universal standards and subject standards included in the GRI reporting framework.

Five steps make up the GRI reporting process:

Step 1: Prepare - Establish a vision for the report, form a team to work on it, prepare an action plan, and schedule a launch meeting.
Step 2: Connect - Organisations identify important stakeholders, organise meetings with them, and establish priorities with them in order to decide on reporting priority and scope.
Step 3: Define - The reporting team chooses the issues for reporting and action as well as the report's subject matter.
Step 4: Monitor - The reporting team keeps track of all actions.

GRI offers 30 different performance indicators that should be included in any sustainability report, relating to topics including: 
* Energy
* Materials
* Water
* Biodiversity
* Compliance
* Overall

* GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 (GRI 2) provides disclosures pertaining to an organisation's governance, strategy, policies, procedures, activities, and engagement with stakeholders. These provide information on the scope and profile of the organisation and aid in setting the scene for comprehending its external effects. 
With investors inquiring more and more frequently about what companies are doing in regard to responsible investment, how they treat employees and vendors, their dedication to sustainability initiatives, and other activities that fall under the ESG umbrella.

* GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (GRI 3): The actions an organisation can take to identify the issues most pertinent to its impacts, or its material topics. It also outlines how the Sector Standards are utilised in this process. Additionally, GRI 3 includes disclosures of the organisation's list of material subjects, how those topics were selected, and how each is managed. Each Standard includes a summary of the subject, disclosures that are particular to the subject, and information on how an organisation manages the impacts that are related to it. An organisation chooses the Topic Standards that are appropriate for the chosen material themes and applies them to reporting.
