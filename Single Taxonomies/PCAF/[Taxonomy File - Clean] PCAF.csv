Financial institutions shall ensure that the chosen point in time provides a representative view on the emissions for that reporting year and shall transparently disclose if large changes close to (before/after) the reporting date affected the results.

As part of this base year emissions recalculation policy, financial institutions shall establish and disclose the significance threshold163 that triggers base year emissions recalculations."
