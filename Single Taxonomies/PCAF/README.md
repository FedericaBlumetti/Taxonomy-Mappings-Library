## Summary Observations
The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) developed the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry as a response to industry demand for a global, standardised approach to measure and report financed emissions. Written by a diverse, global team of financial institutions for financial institutions, the Standard combines deep industry insight with the rigour of the GHG Protocol, the supplier of the world's most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards. This is an industry-led effort to make it possible for financial institutions to systematically track and report the greenhouse gas emissions financed by their investments and loans. These emissions are often referred to as portfolio climate impact or sponsored/financed emissions. Currently, the PCAF programme has more than 100 banks and investors signed up.

The Standard has been reviewed by the GHG Protocol and is in conformance with the requirements set forth in the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, for Category 15 investment activities.

## Further Commentary 
The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry provides detailed methodological guidance for asset classes. These techniques, which have been extensively tested by banks and investors, aid in the measurement and disclosure of GHG emissions linked to six asset classes: listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, project finance, commercial real estate, mortgages, and loans for motor vehicles. This coverage will be increased in subsequent versions of the Standard, which will build upon and enhance its current techniques.

By implementing this Standard, financial institutions are given standardised, reliable metrics for calculating funded emissions, a statistic that allows them to:

* Evaluate climate related risks considered by the TCFD recommendations.
* Use the sectoral decarbonisation strategy created by the Science Based Objectives programme to set science-based targets (SBTs).
* Involve stakeholders in a report using the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
* Develop cutting-edge financial solutions that aid in the transition to a net-zero emissions economy by informing climate strategy and activities.

The cooperation is motivated by the knowledge that shareholders are supporting a healthy environment more and more. By becoming a member of PCAF, businesses may contribute to the development of a standardised framework for financial institutions to assess funded emissions as well as a practical instrument for managing these emissions, a crucial aspect of combating climate change.

Financial institutions now have access to internationally standardised, reliable, transparent ways to reliably monitor and publish funded emissions thanks to the Standard, and according to PCAF Executive Director Giel Linthorst, "Financial institutions can now rest assured that they will be using a leading global standard for GHG accounting of financial assets, a step that can contribute to further their climate-related business goals."
