## Summary Observations
PCAF is a global, industry-led initiative of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with loans and investments, known as financed emissions. Currently, over 200 financial institutions have committed to the initiative. PCAF is concerned exclusively with emissions financed by a firm's loans and investments which can be directyly linked to disclsoure 305-3 of thr GRI 305 dislcosures. 305-3  include indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions not included in energy indirect GHG emissions that occur outside of the organization, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Another key link is that PCAF describes three different intensity metrics in use - economic, physical and weighted average carbon and this can be mapped to 305-4 whihc says that GHG emissions intensity expresses the amount of GHG emissions per unit of activity, output, or any other organization-specific metric.
