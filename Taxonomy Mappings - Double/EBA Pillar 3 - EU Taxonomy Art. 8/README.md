## Summary Observations

- The concept of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) features in both the EBA Pillar 3 regulation and the EU Taxonomy Article 8 Delegated Disclosures Act.
- This means that the GAR disclosures (templates 7 & 8) required under EBA Pillar 3 align very closely with the GAR KPIs reportable by credit institutions under EU Taxonomy Art. 8.
- Banks will therefore be able to reuse datasets in complying with both of sets of regulatory reporting requirements.
