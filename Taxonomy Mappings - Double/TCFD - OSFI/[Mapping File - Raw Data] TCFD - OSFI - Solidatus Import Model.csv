Governance,1,Strategy,Recommended Disclosure b),,"Management take into account the strategies and implementation processes involved in strategic financial planning and short, medium and long term process",Full
Governance,2,Strategy,Recommended Disclosure c),,Both regimes take into account their processes for a transition plan towards net zero Carbon economy (< 2C) however OSFI focuses specifically on the Climate Transition Plan,Full
Governance,3,Governance,Recommended Disclosure b),,TCFD does not take into account managements compensation. TCFD focus on the granular level in which they focus on managements process towards climate related issues,Partial
Governance,4,Governance,Recommended Disclosure b),,OSFI takes into Risk Appetite Framework and Enterprise Risk Management but the similarities involve in the management processes involved and the adaptions to it,Partial
Risk Management,5,Risk Management,Recommended Disclosure a),,"OSFI  takes into account portfolio exposures when looking at climate risks such as market risk, credit risk etc. TCFD describe their risk management processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. An important aspect of this description is how organizations determine the relative significance of climate-related risks in relation to other risks",Partial
Risk Management,6,Risk Management,Recommended Disclosure c),,OSFI collects and structures data to help management identify and assess specific risks and TCFD is closely aligned with the description of management process to collect and structure,Partial
Risk Management,6,Risk Management,Recommended Disclosure b),,Both regimes focus on the management process in identifying risks,Full
Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing,13,Strategy,Recommended Disclosure a),,"TCFD description of what they consider to be the relevant short-, medium-, and longterm horizons, taking into consideration the useful life of the organization’s assets or infrastructure and the fact that climate-related issues often manifest themselves over the medium and longer terms. FRFI should use results as an input into its capital and financial planning processes. The difference being FRFI include scress testing on scenario analysis when inputting issues",Partial
Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing,14,Strategy,Recommended Disclosure c),,"Organizations should describe how resilient their strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities, taking into consideration a transition to a low-carbon economy consistent with a 2°C or lower scenario and, where relevant to the organization, scenarios consistent with increased physical climate-related risks. The FRFI should consider scenarios that encompass both physical and transition risks, and the potential interplay between these two types of risks. The difference again being the methodology and data collection processes",Partial
