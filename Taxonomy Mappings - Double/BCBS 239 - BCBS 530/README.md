# Mapping: BCBS 239 Risk Aggregation - BCBS 530 Climate Risk

## Project Summary

Pairwise taxonomy mapping between the BCBS Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting and BCBS Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks.

## Summary Observations

- Significant overlaps were identified between BCBS 239 and BCBS Climate Risk in terms of the requirements for risk management and reporting capabilities.
- This implies that banks should be able to leverage previous implementations in line with BCBS 239, in order to align with the new guidelines for the management of climate-related financial risks.
- There are also differences noted between the two frameworks, particularly given the narrower focus of BCBS 239 on risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.
- BCBS Climate Risk, on the other hand, covers a wider array of climate risk management themes, with clear similarities to the TCFD Recommendations.

## Further Commentary

One of the most significant changes to banking processes occurred following the 2008 global financial crisis. It entailed banks making a huge overhaul of their risk processes. This was done under Basel III through BCBS 239, Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting.

In Nov-2021, following the rapid rise in regulatory focus on climate change and its potential impact on the financial system, the BCBS published a new consultative paper, BCBS 530, Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks.

Since Basel III, there has been a further update from the BCBS under Basel IV. While there is no date set for Basel V, there is general expectation in the financial community that this update will focus substantially on incorporating climate risk into the bank capital adequacy of framework. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the consultation paper BCBS 530 will result in a BCBS standard for climate risk.

In anticipation of the likelihood of Basel V adopting the principles of BCBS 530, the objective of this taxonomy mapping and the accompanying research paper is to understand how one might gain an advantage by assessing those principles and by comparing them with BCBS 239. This can then help to inform banks on the potential impact of climate risk on their business, operating and infrastructure models.
