## Summary Observations
* The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and EFRAG have both issued exposure drafts of standards for sustainability reporting. The ISSB’s standards are based on the concept of “single materiality,” those sustainability issues that matter to enterprise value creation. EFRAG’s standards emphasize “double materiality,” those sustainability issues that also affect society in general along environmental and social dimensions. 

* The two sets of proposals would use the same reporting entity as the financial statements as the starting point for disclosures. However, companies would need to carefully consider their broader value chain for at least some sustainability disclosures. This may bring companies into the scope of multiple frameworks if they
are part of sub-consolidations or consolidated groups.

* To ensure the success of its mission, EFRAG is committed to developing standards under a robust due process ensuring transparency as well as under public oversight.  For this elaboration EFRAG seeks cooperation with major contributors to sustainability reporting standard setting, at European and global level. 
Therefore, EFRAG is looking forward to a fruitful cooperation with the ISSB.

* The work of both the ISSB and EFRAG is important and highly complementary. The former can establish a “global baseline.” EFRAG can build on this to move further and faster and perhaps mark a future path for certain aspects of ISSB standards, and create a sort of dynamic materiality, where material issues from the perspective of impacts today can become material to enterprise value creation tomorrow.

## Further Commentary 
* A few comparisons and similarities include: ESRS and ISSB proposals include the four main pillars of TCFD to frame their proposals, and, in addition to the pillars, integrate the underlying 11 disclosure recommendations of the framework. Both ESRS and ISSB introduce additional requirements and call for different disclosure definitions or locations for certain components, but otherwise fully align with TCFD guidance.
* Companies should be prepared to calculate emissions to disclose for the FY23 reporting year because the ESRS and ISSB plans specifically ask for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from an issuer's upstream and downstream value chains). In contrast to ESRS, which mandates Scope 3 disclosure regardless of materiality, IFRS leaves materiality up to users' and regulators' assessment because it cannot impose ISSB requirements across jurisdictions.
* The principles of the ISSB are founded on the idea of "single materiality", or those sustainability concerns that are important for generating company value. The "double materiality" of sustainability issues, which have an impact on both the environment and society as a whole, is emphasised by EFRAG standards.
* The ISSB proposals are mainly investor based, whereas EFRAG focuses on a much wider and multi-stakeholder audience.
* EFRAG requirements are much more granular for sustainability impacts, risk and opportunities, while ISSB includes general requiremnts that are not only climate-based but relate also to other significant sustainablity-related risks and opportunities.
