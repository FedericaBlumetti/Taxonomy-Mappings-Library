## Summary Observations
* At a high level, the ISSB aims to help companies streamline their sustainability disclosures to facilitate an “apples to apples” comparison by investors. Currently, companies and financial institutions utilize a variety of voluntary frameworks — often referred to as the ESG “alphabet soup” — to guide disclosure in sustainability reports and other corporate communications. The ISSB intends to detail baseline requirements that ensure companies provide investors with a complete set of disclosures on sustainability risks and opportunities that could affect enterprise value, in order to complement the information provided in financial statements. 
The General Requirements Standard creates an umbrella of disclosure expectations that will apply across all of the ISSB’s forthcoming sustainability topic-specific standards, including the Climate Standard. ISSB has indicated it will consult with stakeholders on other sustainability topics later in 2022, potentially including water, biodiversity and social issues. 

* The ISSB’s General Requirements and Climate Standards are based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The recommendations of both the ISSB and the TCFD fall into four broad pillars — governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets — corresponding to how the disclosing company approaches these four practices in the context of a given sustainability topic. Although the TCFD’s recommendations are specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, the ISSB’s General Requirements Standard advises that this approach be applied to all sustainability issues that could impact enterprise value, such as those posed by social or nature-related issues.

## Further Commentary
The ISSB has made a [comparison](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/comparison-draft-ifrs-s2-climate-related-disclosures-with-the-tcfd-recommendations.pdf) of the ideas and the recommendations of the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) available.
TCFD is the baseline on which the ISSB disclosures are based, however there are some notable differences from the 4 pillars of TCFD including: 
* Governance
  * The Exposure Draft complies with the TCFD governance guideline; however, it calls for the disclosure of more governance-related information, including more precision regarding individuals' names, roles, and duties as well as particular controls and processes. In summary, ISSB requires more granular and additional information to be disclosed.
  
* Strategy
  * The Exposure Draft also takes a somewhat different approach to transition plans, making clear demands regarding the disclosure of emission reduction goals and carbon offset usage.
  * The Exposure Draft also requires some additional information regarding resilience of the discloser's strategy and business model to climate-related risks.
  
* Risk Management 
  * With a few exceptions including disclosure of methods used to identify and prioritise opportunities, input parameters used to determine risks, and whether processes have changed, the exposure draft is aligned with the TCFD suggested disclosures.

* Metrics and Targets
  * Suggests a few extra particular disclosures that should be carefully read.
  * The TCFD advice and the Exposure Draft both call for the same types of cross-industry measurements. The Exposure Draft proposes new disclosure rules for industry-based indicators pertinent to an entity's sector and operations.
  * The Exposure Draft mandates a novel approach to the disclosure of greenhouse gases that must be carefully examined, and Scope 3 emission disclosure is now a prerequisite.
