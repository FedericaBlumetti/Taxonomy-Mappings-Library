In describing their targets, organizations should consider including the following: ‒ whether the target is absolute or intensity based; ‒ time frames over which the target applies; ‒ base year from which progress is measured; and ‒ key performance indicators used to assess progress against targets. Organizations disclosing medium-term or long-term targets should also disclose associated interim targets in aggregate or by business line, where available. Where not apparent, organizations should provide a description of the methodologies used to calculate targets and measures.",,,,,,
