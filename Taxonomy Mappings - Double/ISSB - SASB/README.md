## Summary Observations

* The ISSB has committed to building on the industry-based SASB Standards and embedding SASB’s industry-based approach to standards development. The ISSB encourages companies and investors to continue to support and use the SASB Standards until they are replaced by IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. SASB Standards play an important role in the ISSB’s Climate-related Disclosures Exposure Draft and General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information Exposure Draft. Use of SASB Standards, therefore, will be good preparation for implementation of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards when they are available for use.
The ISSB has also committed to enhancing the international applicability of the SASB Standards prior to the effective date of the General Requirements Exposure Draft.
SASB Standards can be used to provide a baseline of investor-focused sustainability disclosure and to implement the principles-based framework recommended by the TCFD, which is also incorporated into the ISSB’s Climate Exposure Draft. Similarly, SASB Standards enable robust implementation of the Integrated Reporting Framework, providing the comparability sought by investors.

* The industry-based SASB Standards are a foundational input to the development of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. The ISSB has committed to build on the industry-based SASB Standards and leverage its industry-based approach to standards development.
Companies are directed to SASB Standards as priority materials for complying with the draft General Requirements Standard in the absence of specific IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Using industry-based disclosure topics and metrics in the SASB Standards enables companies to address a range of sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
Additionally, the ISSB’s Climate Exposure Draft proposes requirements for disclosure of material information about significant climate-related risks and opportunities, including industry-based requirements derived from SASB Standards.

* All open SASB Standards projects were transitioned to the ISSB as of August 1, 2022, when the Value Reporting Foundation was consolidated into the IFRS Foundation. The SASB Standards Board’s recommended changes were passed to the ISSB for further deliberation and will be subject to the IFRS Foundation’s due process.
Work is expected to continue on these projects, although upcoming public consultation on the ISSB’s future agenda priorities will inform their detailed delivery plan.

## Further Commentary

Since SASB develops sustainability accounting standards most relevant to the financial performance in 77 industries, we can see a clear comparison with ISSB S2 appendix B as that identifies and discloses information on climate risks and opportunities for industries also. The industries we decided that would be most relevant to map and compare were asset management and custody activities, insurance, commercial banking, investment banking and brokerage, and mortgage finance. 

In order to ensure connection and compatibility between IFRS Accounting Standards and the ISSB's standards — IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards — the ISSB will work closely with the IASB. In order to give investors and other capital markets participants comprehensive information to meet their needs, each board will be independent and their standards will complement one another. The creation of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards was fundamentally influenced by the sector-based SASB Standards. The ISSB has promised to expand upon the industry-based SASB Standards and utilise a method for developing standards that is also industry-based.
In contrast to SASB, the ISSB also includes general requirements touching on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets, as well as its industry based disclosures which were derived From SASB Standards.
