## Summary Observations

- In January 2022, CDSB, along with the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF), were consolidated into the IFRS Foundation to provide staff and resources to the new International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
- Both the CDSB and therefore the ISSB disclosure frameworks align closely with the TCFD recommendations, as evidenced by this taxonomy mapping.

## Further Commentary

CDSB plans to undertake an integrated, cross-institutional work program that will support successful uptake and implementation of the TCFD’s recommendations. Phases of this ongoing effort will involve developing practical and technical guidance and resources, which may include refreshing the CDSB Framework. Specific efforts to promote harmonization within the climate-reporting ecosystem may include the following:
* Refreshing CDSB’s Climate Change Reporting Framework to align with the TCFD recommendations, potentially merging with the CDSB Framework for Reporting Environmental Information & Natural Capital.
* Drawing on related practice, including from financial accounting, risk management and governance frameworks and codes (where relevant to the recommendations), as well as from developers of behavioural standards (such as ISO) that inform internal corporate practice (eventually reflected in external reports).
* CDSB will also continue its engagement with the corporate sector globally and with regulators to further the technical understanding and practical application of the TCFD recommendations and promote the mainstreaming of high-quality climate disclosure.

The TCFD recommendations represent an important advancement in the global movement to include environmental, social, and governance data and information in mainstream company disclosures to the benefit of companies, investors, and the economy at large. CDSB fully supports the objectives of the TCFD and appreciate the important leadership and political will of the Task Force in raising the profile of climate-related risks and opportunities among mainstream participants in the financial system.
