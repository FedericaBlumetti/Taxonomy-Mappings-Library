## Summary Observations
Sustainability frameworks differ from sustainability standards, yet both complement each other as the standards make frameworks actionable. The frameworks provide principle-based guidance on how information is organized, prepared and the general topics covered, while the standards provide specific, detailed and replicable requirements for what to report for each topic, including metrics.

GRI and SASB are standards for disclosing sustainability information.

The GRI standards focus on the companyâ€™s ESG impacts on sustainable development, which concern a wide range of stakeholders, including investors. Thus, each set of standards complement each other and do not act as a substitute for each other. SASB standards focus on environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues that are expected to have a financially material impact on the company (financial condition, operating performance, or risk profile) mainly catering to investors.

In July 2020, GRI and SASB announced a collaborative workplan, which aims to:

* Provide clarity on the application of their reporting standards
* Help to understand how the sustainability performance data they provide is used
* Help consumers of sustainability data understand the similarities and differences in the information generated from these standards.
* Help companies and investors successfully use the GRI and SASB standards to provide the depth and breadth of disclosure that many stakeholders require
* For the purposes of disclosure, SASB accounts for indirect emissions by capturing operational and/or strategic factors that give rise to such emissions.  This applies to the following SASB categories: Product Design & Lifecycle Management, Supply Chain Management and Materials Sourcing & Efficiency
