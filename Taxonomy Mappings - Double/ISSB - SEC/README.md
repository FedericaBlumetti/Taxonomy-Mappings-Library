## Summary Observations

- Both ISSB Exposure Draft S2 and the SEC's proposed Climate Disclosure rule are based on the TCFD Recommendations, meaning that there is a significant degree of alignment between the two disclosure frameworks.
- In relation to industry-specific disclosures, ISSB is more precise with specific quantitative disclosure requirements. Some of these may be covered under the SEC's more general qualitative requirements, however the SEC rule does not require industry-specific disclosures per se.
- Format of the draft texts for these frameworks differed, with ISSB taking a more concise approach outlining disclosure requirements by paragraph. The SEC text is more descriptive, meaning specific requirements are more difficult to define and must be interpreted within large text blocks.

## Further Commentary 
* The SEC's disclosure plans combine prescriptive rules-based disclosure requirements, which specifically specify issuers what must be given, with principles-based disclosure requirements, which provide the registrant significant choice over what information to disclose. The proposals' scopes significantly vary as well. The SEC plan only addresses climate change. The ISSB proposal now comprises broad rules and procedures for climate disclosure, but plans to include more ESG subjects in the future.
* Although the SEC's proposal for disclosure of information linked to climate change is restricted to climate, the agency's regulatory agenda indicates that it is likely to propose disclosure rules for other ESG-related issues, including board diversity, human capital, and cybersecurity. Although the scope of the ISSB's proposal is intended to broaden with subsequent exposure draughts, which are anticipated to eventually encompass the whole ESG landscape, it solely addresses climate and other environmental disclosure topics.
* ISSB is more aligned with TFCD than the SEC. With regard governance, strategy and risk, ISSB includes descriptions of transition plans and various scenario analysis and the difference with the SEC is that the disclosure is required only if the company uses the item and optional reporting of climate related opportunities
