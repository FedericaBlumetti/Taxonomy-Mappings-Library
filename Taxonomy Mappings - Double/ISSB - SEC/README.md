## Summary Observations

- Both ISSB Exposure Draft S2 and the SEC's proposed Climate Disclosure rule are based on the TCFD Recommendations, meaning that there is a significant degree of alignment between the two disclosure frameworks.
- In relation to industry-specific disclosures, ISSB is more precise with specific quantitative disclosure requirements. Some of these may be covered under the SEC's more general qualitative requirements, however the SEC rule does not require industry-specific disclosures per se.
- Format of the draft texts for these frameworks differed, with ISSB taking a more concise approach outlining disclosure requirements by paragraph. The SEC text is more descriptive, meaning specific requirements are more difficult to define and must be interpreted within large text blocks.

## Further Commentary

* The SEC's disclosure plans combine prescriptive rules-based disclosure requirements, which specify to issuers what must be reported, with principles-based disclosure requirements, which provide the registrant significant choice over what information to disclose. The proposals' scopes significantly vary as well. The SEC plan only addresses climate change. The ISSB proposal now comprises broad rules and procedures for climate disclosure, but plans to include more ESG subjects in the future.
* Although the SEC's proposal for disclosure of information linked to sustainability is restricted to climate, the agency's regulatory agenda indicates that it is likely to propose disclosure rules for other ESG-related issues, including board diversity, human capital, and cybersecurity. Although the scope of the ISSB's proposal is intended to broaden with subsequent exposure drafts, which are anticipated to eventually encompass the whole ESG landscape, it currently addresses climate-related disclosure topics only.
* ISSB is more aligned with TFCD than the SEC. With regard governance, strategy and risk, ISSB includes descriptions of transition plans and various scenario analysis, whereas the SEC disclosures are required only if the company uses these techniques. Reporting of climate related opportunities is also optional under the SEC proposal.
