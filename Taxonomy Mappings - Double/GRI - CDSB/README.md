## Summary Observations
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an international independent organisation that helps businesses, governments and other organisations understand and communicate the impact of businesses on critical sustainability issues such as climate change. GRI provides Guidelines that reflect the perspective of a diverse range of stakeholders that are aiming at transparency. 

The CDSB Framework explains how environmental/natural capital information disclosed in a report made using GRI sustainability reporting guidelines can be presented in a mainstream financial report. The Framework provides the supporting architecture to link non-financial and financial information in companiesâ€™ mainstream reports. This enables companies and investors to minimise risk and identify opportunities by disclosing and reducing impacts on the environment. By identifying and developing common disclosures, GRI and CDSB aim to increase the efficiency of reporting.
