## Summary Observations

- There is significant overlap between the disclosure requirements of ISSB S2 and EBA Pillar 3, both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Both are clearly linked to the recommendations of the TCFD.
- Although quantitative disclosure requirements of the two frameworks are often similar, there are differences in the precise wordings which make exact mappings difficult. 
- Opportunities were identified for the use of reporting items under EBA Pillar 3 as proxies for certain ISSB disclosure requirements. In particular, aspects of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) reportable under EBA Pillar 3 may offer reasonable estimates of the proportion of assets exposed to climate transition and physical risks or opportunities.

## Further Commentary

The EBA ESG Pillar 3 package will help to address shortcomings in institutions’ current ESG disclosures at EU level by setting mandatory and consistent disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables and associated instructions. It will also help establish best practices at an international level. It is similar to ISSB in the way that it sets out comparable quantitative disclosures on climate-change related transition and physical risks, including information on exposures towards carbon related assets and assets subject to chronic and acute climate change events.
* The EBA supports the introduction of international and European standards to meet the growing demand for comparable, accurate, and pertinent corporate data on sustainability-related issues. The EBA also recognises the importance of close coordination between the ISSB and EFRAG as they close out their own consultations to ensure consistency.
* As a tool to demonstrate how institutions are integrating sustainability considerations into their risk management, business models, and strategy as well as their path toward the Paris Agreement goals, EBA Pillar 3 offers specific disclosures and key performance indicators, such as a green asset ratio (GAR) and a banking book taxonomy alignment ratio (BTAR), which are not present under ISSB.
* The disclosure requirements implemented are organised by risk category just like under ISSB and TCFD. The categories include governance, business model and strategy, and risk management.
* To guarantee improved uniformity, comparability, and meaningfulness of these disclosures by institutions, the EBA has also established the disclosure dates, granular templates, tables, and instructions.

## S2 Industry-based Disclosures - Financial

During an initial research phase, industry-based requirements for sectors B16 and B19 (commercial banks and mortgage finance respectively) were reviewed and compared with existing disclosure requirements under TCFD, SASB and EBA Pillar 3. Of the 11 industry-specific ISSB S2 metrics:

-	4 exist already under SASB
-	Another 4 exist under EBA Pillar 3
-	The remaining 3 are partly covered by existing requirements under SASB or EBA Pillar 3

There is a significant degree of overlap with existing requirements. These are not always identical in terms of wording and/or methodology, however should provide at least a basis for calculating new metrics.

The following differences were noted when mapping between ISSB S2 (Annex 1 - Industry-based disclosures) and EBA Pillar 3:

- ISSB requires counterparty/financed emissions by industry and asset class. EBA Pillar 3 (Template 1) disaggregates by industry only.
- ISSB requires separate disclosures for Scope 1, 2 & 3 counterparty emissions, whereas EBA Pillar 3 (Template 1) groups Scope 1 & 2 together.
- ISSB requires counterparty emissions for all industries, EBA Pillar 3 only requires ‘carbon-related’ or ‘relevant’ industries.
- Industry classifications: ISSB uses GICS, EBA Pillar 3 uses NACE. These classification systems can be mapped to each other to assist with the alignment of ISSB and EBA Pillar 3 reporting.

## S1/S2 Comparison

An initial comparison was also completed between disclosure requirements under ISSB S2 and existing TCFD and EBA Pillar 3 requirements. Due to S1 relating to general sustainability rather than specific topics, it can not currently be compared to existing frameworks.

Of 47 cross-industry S2 disclosures analysed, only 3 disclosures do not appear in the above existing reporting frameworks. These are qualitative disclosures – the quantitative disclosures (mainly falling under the Metrics and Targets section) are at least in part covered by TCFD or EBA Pillar 3.
