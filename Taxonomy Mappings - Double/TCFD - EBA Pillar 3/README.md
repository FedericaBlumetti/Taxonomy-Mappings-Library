## Summary Observations
* The European Banking Authority (EBA) has published its final draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on Pillar 3 disclosures on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks. The draft puts forward comparable disclosures to show how climate change may exacerbate other risks within institutions’ balance sheets, how institutions are mitigating those risks, and their ratios, including the Green Asset Ratio (GAR), on exposures financing taxonomy-aligned activities such as those consistent with the Paris agreement goals.
  * Disclosure of information on ESG risks is a vital tool to promote market discipline, allowing stakeholders to assess banks’ ESG related risks and sustainable finance strategy. The EBA ESG Pillar 3 package will help to address shortcomings of institutions’ current ESG disclosures at EU level by setting mandatory and consistent disclosure requirements, through the use of granular templates, tables and associated instructions. It will also help establish best practices at an international level.
  * In line with the requirements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the draft ITS set out comparable quantitative disclosures on climate-change related transition and physical risks, including information on exposures towards carbon related assets and assets subject to chronic and acute climate change events. They also include quantitative disclosures on institutions’ mitigating actions supporting their counterparties in the transition to a carbon neutral economy and in the adaptation to climate change. In addition, they include KPIs on institutions’ asset financing activities that are environmentally sustainable according to the EU taxonomy (GAR and BTAR), such as those consistent with the European Green Deal and the Paris agreement goals.
  * When developing these standards, the EBA has built on the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (FSB-TCFD) recommendations, the Commission’s non-binding guidelines on climate-change reporting, and on the EU Taxonomy.

* The TCFD recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures are widely adoptable and applicable to organisations across sectors and jurisdictions. They are designed to solicit decision-useful, forward-looking information that can be included in mainstream financial filings. The recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The TCFD recommendations are fully described in the TCFD recommendations [report](https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report.pdf).

## Further Commentary

The EBA ESG Pillar 3 package will help to address shortcomings in institutions’ current ESG disclosures at EU level by setting mandatory and consistent disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables and associated instructions. It will also help establish best practices at an international level. It is similar to ISSB in the way that it sets out comparable quantitative disclosures on climate-change related transition and physical risks, including information on exposures towards carbon related assets and assets subject to chronic and acute climate change events.

* The EBA supports the introduction of international and European standards to meet the growing demand for comparable, accurate, and pertinent corporate data on sustainability-related issues. The EBA also recognises the importance of close coordination between the ISSB and EFRAG as they close out their own consultations to ensure consistency.
* As a tool to demonstrate how institutions are integrating sustainability considerations into their risk management, business models, and strategy as well as their path toward the Paris Agreement goals, EBA Pillar 3 offers specific disclosures and key performance indicators, such as a green asset ratio (GAR) and a banking book taxonomy alignment ratio (BTAR), which are not present under ISSB.
* The disclosure requirements implemented are organised by category just like under ISSB and TCFD. The categories covered are governance, business model and strategy, and risk management.
* To guarantee improved uniformity, comparability, and meaningfulness of these disclosures by institutions, the EBA has also established the disclosure dates, granular templates, tables, and instructions.
