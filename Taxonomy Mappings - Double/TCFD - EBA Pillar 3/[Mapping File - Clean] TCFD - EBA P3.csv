Examples of methodologies to compute the carbon emission of companies include, the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, developed by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials 8 (PCAF, of particular relevance for the TCFD), or the Carbon Disclosure Project9 . The estimation of scope 3 emissions per sector shall be done in a proportionate way: e.g. by taking the institution’s exposures (loans and advances, debt securities and equity holdings) towards the counterparty compared to the total liabilities (accounting liabilities and shareholders’ equity) of the counterparty. In the narrative accompanying the template institutions shall provide detailed explanations of the data sources used and of the methodology that they have applied for the estimation of their scope 3 GHG emissions. In particular, institutions shall explain whether they are disclosing (i) reported emissions (emissions are collected from the borrower or investee company directly); (ii) physical activity-based emissions (emissions are estimated by the reporting financial institution based on primary physical activity data collected from the borrower or investee), and/or (iii) economic activity-based emissions (emissions are estimated by the reporting financial institution based on economic activity data collected from the borrower or investee company). Where institutions are not yet estimating their counterparties’ emissions associated with their financing activities, including lending and investment activities, they shall disclose information on their plans to implement methodologies to estimate and disclose this information. All institutions shall disclose information in columns i to k of the template as of 30 June 2024 first disclosure reference date.",,
