## Summary Observations
To assist businesses in more successfully implementing the TCFD requirements, SASB Standards offer an industry-specific collection of climate-related disclosure issues and related indicators. Alongside the TCFD recommendations, the SASB Standards have contributed fundamental instruments for effectively delivering climate- and sustainability-related financial disclosure to capital markets. As a result, the S1 General Requirements Standard and S2 Climate-related Disclosures Standard from the ISSB include important elements of the two, acknowledging that sustainability disclosure should include both qualitative disclosures and quantitative measurements.

## Further Commentary
Similar to TCFD, SASB is an ESG disclosure framework that is frequently utilised by financial stakeholders including loan holders, insurers, and investors. However, TCFD focuses on how climate change may affect an organization's capacity to produce value, whereas SASB focuses on quantifying and reporting the external ESG impacts and risks of an organization's performance according to 77 different industry standards.

The emphasis of TCFD and SASB is on financial materiality. Whereas SASB offers a retrospective view of sustainability performance, TCFD is more concerned with an organization's attitude to sustainability and climate change as well as how prepared it is to handle the risks and opportunities that come with it. The two frameworks are therefore not interchangeable but rather complementary. Many investors have favoured the TCFD and SASB frameworks given their focus on financially-material ESG risk factors.

Combining SASB and TCFD recommendations may contribute to a "Gold Standard" regime, in the form of the ISSB exposure drafts:

* Qualitative: Taking recommendations from TCFD with regard to governance, risk management, strategy and targets and metrics to fully understand a company's position and future prospects, and;
* Quantitative: Including metrics derived from SASB, integrating industry-specific components of accountability and comparability to financial disclosure connected to sustainability.
