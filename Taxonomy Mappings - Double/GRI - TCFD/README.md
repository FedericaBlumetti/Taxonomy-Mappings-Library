## Summary Observations
GRI welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),
and we are keen to deepen the dialogue between the TCFD and GRI to ensure a constructive, mutuallyreinforcing collaboration. We call for establishing direct collaboration between the TCFD and GRI to explore how the GRI Standards can be used as a basis for the implementation of the TCFD
Recommendations. GRI commends the TCFD for setting goals that are ambitious yet suitable for near-term adoption:
developing a singular, accessible framework for disclosing the financial implications of climate-related risk
information, and taking this further by proposing a scenario analysis and, a detailed draft implementation
guide.

The main connection between GRI and TCFD is that organizations that have made GHG emissions reduction commitments, operate in jurisdictions that have made such commitments, or have agreed to meet investor expectations regarding GHG emissions reductions should describe their plans for transitioning to a low-carbon economy, which could include GHG emissions targets and specific activities intended to reduce GHG emissions in their operations and value chain or to otherwise support the transition
Disclosure of both absolute emissions across an organizationâ€™s value chain and relevant emissions intensity provides insight into how a given organization may be affected by policy, regulatory, market, and technology responses to limit climate change must be disclosed in both regimes.
